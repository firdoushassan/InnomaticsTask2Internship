# Company Directory Portal

This project(TASK 2) was completed as part of my internship with **Innomatics Research Labs**. 
The task was to build a fully responsive **Company Directory Portal** using only HTML and CSS. 
The portal provides employees with a way to register, displays a list of employees, shows detailed employee information, and 
includes an embedded map for the company's location.

## üìù Project Goal

The goal of the project was to create a responsive company directory portal with the following key components:

- **Employee Registration Form**: A form where users can register employees by entering their name, email, department, employee ID, and profile picture URL.
- **Employee List**: Displays registered employees' names and emails as clickable links.
- **Employee Details Table**: Shows employee information in a tabular format including name, employee ID, department, and profile picture.
- **Embedded Map**: A Google Map is embedded using the `<iframe>` element to showcase the company‚Äôs location.

## üöÄ Features Added

In addition to the core features, I implemented several additional enhancements:

- **Responsive Design**: The layout automatically adjusts to fit desktop, tablet, and mobile screens, providing a smooth experience across devices.
- **Advanced CSS Styling**:
  - Styled buttons and links with **hover effects** for better interactivity.
  - **Alternating row colors** in the employee table to enhance readability.
  - Custom form styling with padding, background color, and border-spacing to make it visually distinct.
